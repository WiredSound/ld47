**Stuck in a Loop**

## Gameplay

* Primarily top-down RPG without combat - can walk around and interact with NPCs and the environment.
* Like the original Legend of Zelda, the world is split into a series of distinct screens/areas (i.e. the camera does not follow the player).
* Certain parts of the game feature 'visual novel'-like cutscenes: a background image is displayed while the player reads text at the bottom of the screen.

## Story

* My take on the theme 'stuck in a loop' is based primarily around the mass extinction events that have occurred on Earth and how these events appear to form a repeating cycle/loop.
* Much of humanity has already been wiped out, leaving the player character searching for some means of escape.
* They hear stories of how the whales escaped the planet just as the extinction event began and now dwell among the stars.
* The game begins as the player character embarks on their quest to join those looking to contact and perhaps soon accompany the whales living in space.
